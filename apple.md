# Apple Platforms
Apple has leveraged their closed ecosystem and tight vertical integration to offer several security features which can be used to authenticate communications. These security features are generally only available when BOTH PEOPLE are communicating from Apple devices.

## Apple ID authenticated communications
### iMessage
A message received via iMessage, as [indicated with a blue bubble](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207006), can considered authenticated. In particular:
* The message was sent using the Apple account indicated; e.g. that person's contact card
* The message was sent from a device the sender logged into with their Appple account

[Please remember the failure conditions for this mode of authentication communication](#failure-conditions).

### FaceTime
A FaceTime call, can considered authenticated. In particular:
* The FaceTime call was initiated using the Apple account indicated; e.g. that person's contact card
* The call was initiated from a device the sender logged into with their Appple account

[Please remember the failure conditions for this mode of authentication communication](#failure-conditions).

## Failure Conditions
### Software Compromise
Like all computerized devices, Apple devices have cybersecurity vulnerabilities in their software. If a person you're communicating with has been the victim of a cybersecurity attack on their device, it can no longer provide any security assurances.

Please encourage everyone you know to keep their [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204) or [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) device up-to-date.

### Physical Compromise
If the device of the person you are trying to communicate with is in the pysical possession of the bad actor, they may be able to impersonate that person. Please note that the vast majority of cybercrime is conducted remotely without physical proximity to victims, and [the limits of this guide](README.md#limits-of-this-guide).
