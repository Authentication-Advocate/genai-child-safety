# Email Security
Email continues to be the bedrock of our digital identities. How would you reset your password for your social media account? Either email or SMS. What about your financial institutions such as banks?

A bad actor gaining access to your email account may provide them with the ability to compromise and exploit MANY or ALL of your other accounts with other services. Your email account should be your best protected account.

* Use a strong password that is UNIQUE; not the same password you use anywhere else OR similar to a password you use anywhere else
    * Consider using a password manager
* Use available methods of multifactor authentication offered by your email provider
    * If possible, use a Passkey to protect yourself from phishing
